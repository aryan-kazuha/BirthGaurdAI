AI-Based Maternal Health Risk Prediction System
Problem Statement
Despite healthcare improvements, maternal and infant mortality remain critical challenges in rural India. 
Many high-risk pregnancies go undetected due to limited resources, irregular check-ups, and lack of early risk prediction. 
Conditions like anemia, hypertension, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia often receive delayed intervention, leading to preventable complications.

Solution Overview
Maternal Health Risk Predictor is an AI-driven decision-support system built to help ASHA workers identify high-risk pregnancies early, particularly in rural and resource-limited settings. Using clinically relevant inputs such as blood pressure, hemoglobin, BMI, blood sugar, pregnancy history, and gestational age, the system predicts risk levels through a LightGBM model optimized for high-risk recall. It delivers clear, actionable outputs with confidence scores and explainability. Key features include multilingual support, voice-based data entry, an intelligent chatbot for guidance, and unique patient IDs to ensure continuity across visits. The platform is assistive, transparent, and aligned with maternal health guidelines to enable timely intervention and better outcomes.
